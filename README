# Modified squashfs-tools

This repository is a fork of the original squashfs-tools one. 
It provides a modified version of some of the tools (especially,
unsquashfs) to deal with some non-compliant POSIX file systems. 
As so, it should be only put into production if you know what 
you are doing, and are aware of the implications of the changes.
